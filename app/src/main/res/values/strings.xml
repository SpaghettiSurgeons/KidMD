    <string name="appendectomy_description">The appendix is a small pouch on the lower right side of your abdomen that is attached to your large intestine.\n \nSometimes it can become blocked from mucus being trapped inside.

    <string name="choledochalCyst">Choledochal Cyst</string>
    <string name="choledochalCyst_description">Choledochal cyst is a problem that occurs in the tubes connecting from the liver to the gallbladder. This tube helps transport bile, which is a liquid that helps break down fats, from the liver to the gallbladder and to the small intestine. Sometimes this tube can get bigger than normal and cause liver problems. The cyst can mess up or block the flow of bile from the liver to the small intestine and cause inflammation and infection in the tubes. If surgery is not done to remove the cyst, the liver can get damaged and not work well.</string>

Usually there is a small space between the lungs and the chest containing a thin layer of fluid. It is important for this area to remain moist and free so that the lung can expand and deflate normally when you breathe. If this area gets blocked with tissue, then it becomes hard for the lung to expand and deflate normally which can create breathing problems. With the help of surgery, this harmful tissue can be removed and the lungs can be saved.</string>
